## Making Changes

### Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch in your local repository. It is a good practice to name your branch appropriately, reflecting the changes you intend to make.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### Commit Guidelines

Follow these guidelines when making commits:

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Use present tense in commit messages (e.g., "Add new feature" instead of "Added new feature").
- Keep commits focused and atomic.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've made the necessary changes, pushed them to your forked repository, and are satisfied with your contributions, you can submit a pull request to the main repository. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Pull Requests" and then "New Pull Request."
3. Choose the branch you've made the changes on (e.g., `feature/new-feature`).
4. Add a descriptive title and detailed description of the changes made in the pull request.
5. Submit the pull request.

Your pull request will then be reviewed by the maintainers. Please be patient, as the review process may take some time.
